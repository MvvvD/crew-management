# crew-management
First non-tutorial project in Spring. Whole project was done by myself, without any guidance/overview 

Back-end for a crew management app
allows for CRUD operation on employees/specific employee by id, reading, updating and "marking as done" tasks, getting basic employees information depending on role/permissions
