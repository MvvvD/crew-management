# crew-management
First non-tutorial project in Spring. Whole project was done by myself, without any guidance/overview 

Back-end for a crew management app  
that allows for:  
CRUD operation on employee list, employee filtered by id/role   
reading, updating and "marking as done" on employee tasks  
getting basic employees information depending on role/permissions
